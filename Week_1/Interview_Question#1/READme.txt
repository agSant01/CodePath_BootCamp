  Alice is a teacher with a class of n children, each of whom has been assigned a
numeric rating. The classroom is seated in a circular arrangement, with Alice at
the top of the circle. She has a number of gold stars to give out based on each
child's rating, but with the following conditions:

  - Each child must receive at least one gold star
  - Any child with a higher rating than his or her immediate neighbor should 
  	get more stars than that neighbor

  The program takes as its input an int[] containing the ratings of each
child, ordered by seating position, and returns an int value for the minimum
total number of stars that Alice will need to give out.
